    "Because statistical analysis of metagenomes may suffer due to genes with low abundance ([Jonsson et. al 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727335/)) we will filter transporters with an average read count <100. This is a tradeoff between producing trustworthy results and producing any results at all (because filtering at higher average read counts will remove too many transporters). In addition, the statistical analysis is performed on representative protein families for each transporter cluster. Representative families are selected by sorting by mean abundance across the samples.\n",
